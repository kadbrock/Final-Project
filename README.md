# Castleruins - Final Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme - Reverse
We thought about making a visual-telling game, which shows the player going back in time and changing the future. In our best attempts, it should appear like the player went back in time to kill an evil king. 

## Game Play
Go back through time to kill the evil king, and bring peace to the world!
Use A and D to move left and right, W to jump, and left click to attack!

## Impediments
It was surprising how hard to was to merge certain projects together, especially levels and different code. However, in the end, most of production went smoothly past the first 24 hours.
